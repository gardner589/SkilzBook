# Project 2 Evaluation
[inline code comments]()
## Technical Requirements
**3: Excelling**
>Includes many well-structured models, and advanced functionality such as authorization, 3rd-party API integration, or other technology not covered in class

Great job with this. It's clear your comfortable with Rails and able to implement multiple models in a single app. Kudos on succesfully implementing Devise too. Some next steps I suggest you take are adding validations and making your controllers more DRY with `before_action`.

## Creativity and Interface
**2: Performing**
>The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation

Very fun app and clear that it was inspired by things you care about (i.e., Tekken - Eddy Gordo 4 lyf). Has a wide application too beyond just video games. I wonder what features you could add that would make this appealing to fans of other things (e.g., board games, sports).

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
>Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

Solid code quality - had no problem reading through your app. There are some places, however, where you could clean up your views (i.e., using CSS to create white space instead of multiple `<br>`s). You should also remove large chunks of commented-out code from your app.

## Deployment and Functionality
**0: Incomplete**
>Application is not deployed, and contains minimal functionality

Were you able to deploy your app? Let me know / send me the link and I'll update this.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**1: Progressing**
>App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application

You submitted the project but I don't see any planning docs (there's an empty `user_stories.md` file) or a readme! Again, feel free to add these and I'll update this feedback.
